## About me

> I'am really keen on web development and that is why I am learning it. I have taken some udemy courses such JavaScript course of Jonas, HTML and CSS and Vue.js course of Andrei. That was great experience and I really liked parts where we had to find some solutions to problems by ourselves. Right now I am learning React on udemy, participating in RS School course ( currently at stage 1 ), and trying to get a job as a web developer. In near future I want to deep dive into backend development, I think it is interesting what is going on there. I really like web development in general.

## English

> I have been watching all content on the Internet in English language, because I think there is much more useful information in English language than in other languages, so that is why I am trying to do everything in English language. I thing a have decent English level at least it is enough to communicate with other native or not native speakers out there.
